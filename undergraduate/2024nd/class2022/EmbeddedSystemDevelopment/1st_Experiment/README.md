+ ### Use of the Compress Backup command
#### ① Pack the/tmp directory into tmp.tar and place it in the/root directory.
`tar cf /root/tmp.tar /tmp/*`

![img](assets/5.6/bc283bf1263a2900d773ba6c8f5df5a.png)

#### ② Compress and package the/tmp directory into tmp.tar.gz, and place it in the/root directory:
`tar zcvf /root/tmp.tar.gz /tmp/*`

![img](assets/5.6/056bddb912becce2bd44a2876160551.png)

#### ③ Compare tmp.tar and tmp.tar.gz size:
`1s -1 /root/tmp.tar /root/tmp.tar.gz`

![img](assets/5.6/7bf040d3ad675c6f99a516fa05ca283.png)

#### ④ Do not unpack, only view the contents of the compressed file tmp.tar.gz:
`tar ztf /root/tmp.tar.gz`

![img](assets/5.6/0d335814469034f3f56e5b4fefac8b8.png)

#### ⑤ Extract the contents of tmp.tar.gz to the/tmp/myshare directory:
`tar zxvf /root/tmp.tar.gz -C /tmp/myshare/`

![img](assets/5.6/a66fbfb76bcf9dfb839e7cb256555b6.png)

#### ⑥ Compress each file in the/tmp directory into. gz format:
`gzip *`

![img](assets/5.6/9c79e17df1062f399a14b6ca22420e1.png)

#### ⑦ List the information of each. gz compressed file in detail, without decompression:
`gzip-1 *`

![img](assets/5.6/a09baf8cd82c22d4d5861dc74ff83b8.png)
#### ⑧ Extract each compressed. gz file and provide detailed information:

`gzip-dv *`

![img](assets/5.6/dc2d50106bcdb5e6f54d232b47f0358.png)


## Questions

**1**  

### Use the `ls` command to view the information under `/root` and redirect the result to save it into the `test.txt` file.

Run the following command:

`sudo ls /root/ `    

> View all files and subdirectory information under the /root directory.

`sudo ls /root > text.txt`

> Write the list of files in the /root directory to the test.txt file.

###  Use disk management and maintenance commands to mount the USB drive to the virtual machine, and copy the `test.txt` file generated in question 1 to the USB drive.

Run the following command:

`sudo cp /tmp/test.txt /mnt/usb/`

> Copy the file test.txt from the /tmp directory to the USB drive.

`ls /mnt/usb`

> Check if the file has been successfully copied to the USB drive.

### Use `ifconfig` to change the IP address of `eth0` to `10.3.0.159` and modify the subnet mask to `255.0.0.0`.

Run the following command:

`sudo ifconfig enp0s3 10.3.0.159`

> change the IP address

`sudo ifconfig enp0s3 netmask 255.0.0.0`

> change the subnet mask

`ifconfig enp0s3`

> Verify the modification

### What is the difference between compression and archiving?

> 

**_Compression:_** _This refers to reducing the size of a file using specific algorithms. Common tools include gzip and bzip2. The compressed file is often a single file._Compression can be lossless (the data is fully restored after decompression) or lossy (some data is lost after decompression, but the loss is usually negligible for the final use).

**_Archiving:_** _This involves combining multiple files or directories into a single file. A commonly used tool is tar. After archiving, the file size may not change, but it makes transmission and storage more convenient.That is, archived files can be as large as the sum of the individual files they replace. Common archiving formats include .tar (Tape Archive).
